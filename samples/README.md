Place the input FASTQ files here. This tutorial assumes:

- `ce_ds.fastq.gz` — Damage-seq reads (C. elegans, wild-type)
- `ce_xr.fastq.gz` — XR-seq reads (C. elegans, wild-type)

Notes:

- Files are gzipped; tools in this tutorial accept `.fastq.gz` directly.
- If you use different filenames, update commands accordingly.
